# Motivation

This document provides the foundation for a DNS, DHCP, and IPAM (DDI) workshop and the resulting strategic concept. It starts with an analysis of the current state, including infrastructure, operational challenges, dependencies, and security considerations such as risk assessments and compliance requirements. This analysis establishes the baseline for identifying inefficiencies and areas for improvement.

Building on these insights, the future state is defined by outlining desired enhancements and requirements for an optimized DDI system. The strategic vision focuses on improving DDI services and aligning them with organizational goals.

To ensure effective management and long-term sustainability, the document presents an operational and governance model that incorporates best practices, role-based access control, and compliance frameworks. Finally, it provides a structured implementation strategy with actionable steps, risk mitigation approaches, and a feasible project schedule. Where relevant, drawings and sketches will be included to support and illustrate the conceptual framework.
